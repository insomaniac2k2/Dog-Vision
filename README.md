# Dog Breed Classifier using Transfer Learning

This is a project that demonstrates how to build a dog breed classifier using transfer learning with MobileNetV2. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the knowledge gained from training a model on a large dataset and apply it to a different but related task, such as classifying dog breeds.

# Overview
In this project, we will use the MobileNetV2 pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base model and fine-tune it for our specific dog breed classification task. The steps involved in building the classifier are as follows:

* Dataset: Gather a dataset of dog images with labeled breed information. This dataset should be divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

* Pre-processing: Perform necessary pre-processing steps on the dataset, such as resizing the images and normalizing pixel values to improve the model's generalization.

* Transfer Learning: Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, which is available in the TensorFlow Keras library, and remove the fully connected layers from the top.

* Model Architecture: Add new fully connected layers on top of the MobileNetV2 base model to adapt it to our classification task. These layers will learn to map the features extracted by the base model to the dog breed classes.

* Training: Train the model using the training dataset and monitor its performance on the validation set. Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, if necessary.

* Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.

* Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new dog images and identify their respective breeds.
